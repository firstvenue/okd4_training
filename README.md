### What resources you'll need for this training
- Red Hat account  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can create one at https://access.redhat.com
- AWS Account (to deploy the cluster in AWS)
- A linux machine or a mac (to run cluster installer)
- (Optional) A machine (which meets [hardware requirements](02-Installation.md#dev-environment-with-codeready-containers) for CodeReady Containers)

#### AWS Cost Estimate <!-- omit in toc -->
#### Cluster with minimal resources <!-- omit in toc -->
| Machine Type | AWS EC2 Type| estimated cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 master node | t4g.xlarge | ~120 USD/month |
| 1 worker node	| t4g.xlarge | ~120 USD/month |
| | |
| **SUM:** | | **~240 USD/month** |
> For a 1 week training period -> ~60-80 USD/week

#### Cluster with complete / recomended resources <!-- omit in toc -->
| Machine Type | AWS EC2 Type| estimated cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 master node | t4g.xlarge | 3x ~120 USD/month |
| 3 worker node	| t4g.xlarge | 3x ~120 USD/month |
| | |
| **SUM:** | | **~720 USD/month** |
> For a 1 week training period -> ~180-220 USD/week

Those prices are slightly overestimated, since the cluster needs a bootstrap server (it's deleted after installation is complete), loadbalancers,  EBS disk, S3 bucket, etc. and those also will cost some amount.

The default configuration for OKD installation is to deploy 3 master and 3 worker nodes, but cluster functionality, application deployment, monitoring, etc. can be used with only 1 master and 1 worker. Throughout this training the method to deploy only the required minimum resources are explained and can be used.
